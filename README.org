* About =org-link-minor-mode=

=org-link-minor-mode= is an Emacs minor mode that enables org-mode style
fontification and activation of bracket links in modes other than
org-mode.

Org-mode bracket links look like this:

:   [[http://www.bbc.co.uk][BBC]]
:   [[org-link-minor-mode]]

With this mode enabled, the links will be made active so you can click
on them and displayed so you can see only the description if present.

Note that =org-toggle-link-display= will also work when this mode is
enabled.

* Using

To use this minor mode, put the file =org-link-minor-mode.el= somewhere
on your load path and use

: M-x load-library org-link-minor-mode

or put the following:

:  (require 'org-link-minor-mode)

in your =.emacs= file.

You can then use:

: M-x org-link-minor-mode

to turn it on in the current buffer.

* Rebuild

The elisp file =org-link-minor-mode.el= is generated from the
corresponding org-mode file =org-link-minor-mode.org= using org-mode's
tangle feature.

To recreate the elisp source file, open =org-link-minor-mode.org= and
issue the command:

: M-x org-babel-tangle
